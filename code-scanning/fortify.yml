# demonstrates the steps to package the code+dependencies, initiate a scan, and optionally import SAST vulnerabilities into GitHub Security    #
# Code Scanning Alerts. Additional information is available in the comments throughout the workflow, the Fortify AST Action and Fortify        #
# product documentation. If you need additional, please contact Fortify support.                                                               #
