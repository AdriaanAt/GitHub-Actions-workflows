# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by

# This workflow leverages containers to do a DAST scan. 
#
# To test a (publicly) reachable url instead of a container remove the `build-image` and `publish-image` job, and replace the localhost target with the website that needs to be scanned/
