# üíÅ The OpenShift Starter workflow will:
# - Checkout your repository
# - Perform a container image build
# - Push the built image to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
# - Log in to your OpenShift cluster
# - Create an OpenShift app from the image and expose it to the internet

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Configure your repository and the workflow with the following steps:
# 1. Have access to an OpenShift cluster. Refer to https://www.openshift.com/try
# 2. Create the OPENSHIFT_SERVER and OPENSHIFT_TOKEN repository secrets. Refer to:
#   - https://github.com/redhat-actions/oc-login#readme
#   - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets
#   - https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_secret_set
# 3. (Optional) Edit the top-level 'env' section as marked with 'üñäÔ∏è' if the defaults are not suitable for your project.
# 4. (Optional) Edit the build-image step to build your project.
#    The default build type is by using a Dockerfile at the root of the repository,
#    but can be replaced with a different file, a source-to-image build, or a step-by-step buildah build.
# 5. Commit and push the workflow file to your default branch to trigger a workflow run.

### The OpenShift Starter workflow will:
# - Checkout your repository
# - Perform a Docker build
# - Push the built image to an image registry
# - Log in to your OpenShift cluster
# - Create an OpenShift app from the image and expose it to the internet.

### Before you begin:
# - Have write access to a container image registry such as quay.io or Dockerhub.
# - Have access to an OpenShift cluster.
#   - For instructions to get started with OpenShift see https://www.openshift.com/try
# - The project you wish to add this workflow to should have a Dockerfile.
#   - If you don't have a Dockerfile at the repository root, see the buildah-build step.
#   - Builds from scratch are also available, but require more configuration.

### To get the workflow running:
# 1. Add this workflow to your repository.
# 2. Edit the top-level 'env' section, which contains a list of environment variables that must be configured.
# 3. Create the secrets referenced in the 'env' section under your repository Settings.
# 4. Edit the 'branches' in the 'on' section to trigger the workflow on a push to your branch.
# 5. Commit and push your changes.
